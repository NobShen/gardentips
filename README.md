My adventure in gardening
- Papaya plant died slowly - root rot was the cause
- Bodhdi plant grows weakly - what is the problem?
- How to make hydrogen peroxide?  DON'T!  It's very explosive!
- SUMMARY: 
- Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with a pinch of salt and put some of this mixture on your toothbrush. Alternatively, you can add it to your regular toothpaste too.
- If you’re looking to get rid of stains and tartar buildup from your teeth, simply rub the white part of the peel directly over your teeth for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Replace orange peel with lemon juice if you want better and faster results.
- Sesame seeds act as a natural scrub that both polishes and cleans your teeth.
- Mix 1 tablespoon of antiseptic mouthwash with 3 tablespoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Gargle this mixture for a couple minutes and follow it up with clean water.
- In a popular procedure calling “oil pulling,” the coconut oil absorbs dirt in the mouth, reduces tartar and plaque, and helps you get rid of bad breath.
- Both tomatoes and strawberries are rich in vitamin С, so you can use them if lemons or oranges aren’t your thing. Chop up and blend either of them into a paste and put it on your teeth.
- Mix 1 teaspoon of pure aloe vera gel, 4 teaspoons of vegetable glycerin, 10 drops of lemon essential oil, and 4 tablespoons of baking soda in 1 cup of water to get a smooth paste.
- Grind the cloves (or find a ready-made powder), add a little olive oil, and apply the mixture to the stained areas.
- Sanguinaria is a plant more commonly known as bloodroot. But it’s not as weird as it seems at first glance; bloodroot extract is often included in toothpaste!
